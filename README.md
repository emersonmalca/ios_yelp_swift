# Project 2 - *Name of App Here*

**Name of your app** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
   - [x] Table rows implemented fully with Stack Views
   - [ ] Implement table view population using RxSwift

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Stack Views work like magic, and just like everything Apple, when magic doesn't work it's a pain to debug. For multiline labels to properly resize themselves they had to be in a Stack View of their own with vertical distribution.

RxSwift looks awesome, specially for MVC and MVVM. Will try full implementation later this week.
